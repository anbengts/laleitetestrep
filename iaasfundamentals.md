Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and more—over the Internet (“the cloud”). Companies offering these computing services are called cloud providers and typically charge for cloud computing services based on usage, similar to how you’re billed for water or electricity at home.

On [What is cloud computing?](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-cloud-computing/) explore the following topics:
* Top benefits of cloud computing
* Types of cloud services: [IaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-iaas/), [PaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-paas/), [SaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-saas/)
* Types of cloud deployments: public, private, hybrid


### What is Azure?

Azure is a comprehensive set of cloud services that developers and IT professionals use to build, deploy, and manage applications through our global network of datacenters. Integrated tools, DevOps, and a marketplace support you in efficiently building anything from simple mobile apps to internet-scale solutions.

Azure is generally available in 36 regions around the world, with plans announced for 6 additional regions. We place a high priority on geographic expansion to enable higher performance, and to support your requirements and preferences regarding data location.

Explore the following:
* Regions available, coming soon and location details
* Products available by region ([Explore products per region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/))

#### Core IaaS Services

Azure is a very broad platform wit both IaaS and PaaS offerings.
Focus will be on IaaS:
* Compute > Virtual Machines & Availability Sets
* Storage > Disks, Blobs & Files
* Networking > Virtual Networks, VPN, Express Route, Load Balancer, DNS & Traffic Manager

### Azure Reference Architecture for IaaS VM

> **SHOW** [Run a Windows VM on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/virtual-machines-windows/single-vm) 

> *Navigation*: https://azure.com > Documentation > Architecture > Reference Architectures > Windows VM workloads > Single VM

We will review concepts that revolve around a whole Single VM architecture on Azure.
Provisioning a VM in Azure involves more moving parts than just the VM itself. There are compute, networking, and storage elements.
Once you understand the concepts, then you can replicate these concepts per your requirements

Explore the [Architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/virtual-machines-windows/single-vm#architecture) section, explaining the elements in the architecture. We'll deep dive in this elements through the next modules.
