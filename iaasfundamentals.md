Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and more—over the Internet (“the cloud”). Companies offering these computing services are called cloud providers and typically charge for cloud computing services based on usage, similar to how you’re billed for water or electricity at home.

On [What is cloud computing?](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-cloud-computing/) explore the following topics:
* Top benefits of cloud computing
* Types of cloud services: [IaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-iaas/), [PaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-paas/), [SaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-saas/)
* Types of cloud deployments: public, private, hybrid

Azure is a comprehensive set of cloud services that developers and IT professionals use to build, deploy, and manage applications through our global network of datacenters. Integrated tools, DevOps, and a marketplace support you in efficiently building anything from simple mobile apps to internet-scale solutions.

Azure is generally available in 36 regions around the world, with plans announced for 6 additional regions. We place a high priority on geographic expansion to enable higher performance, and to support your requirements and preferences regarding data location.

Explore the following:
* Regions available, coming soon and location details
* Products available by region ([Explore products per region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/))
