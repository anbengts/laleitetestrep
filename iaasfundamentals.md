## Core IaaS Services

Azure is a very broad platform wit both IaaS and PaaS offerings.
Core IaaS Services:
* [Compute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/#pivot=products&panel=Compute) > Virtual Machines & Availability Sets
* [Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/#pivot=products&panel=storage) > Disks, Blobs & Files
* [Networking](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/#pivot=products&panel=network) > Virtual Networks, VPN, Express Route, Load Balancer, DNS & Traffic Manager

### Azure Reference Architecture for IaaS VM

> *Navigation*: https://azure.com > Documentation > Architecture > Reference Architectures > Windows VM workloads > Single VM

We will review concepts that revolve around a whole Single VM architecture on Azure.
Provisioning a VM in Azure involves more moving parts than just the VM itself. There are compute, networking, and storage elements.
Once you understand the concepts, then you can replicate these concepts per your requirements

Explore the [Architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/virtual-machines-windows/single-vm#architecture) section, explaining the elements in the architecture. We'll deep dive in this elements through the next modules.
