## Summary

This project has the following goals:
* Guarantee consistency across our public and private GitHub resources.
* Reach more customers with the content we own on a public GitHub repository.
* Leverage slideless deliveries and the reuse of existing public content. The content in our public GitHub repository should be:
    * Content that currently does not exist in the public documentation (and, when applicable, we should make sure we provide that feedback to the right product teams),
    * Custom content (e.g. specific walkthrought for the scenarios we support).
* Leverage the private repository for internal guidance on how to support customers across different scenarios.
