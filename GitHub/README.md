## Executive Update

This project has following goals:
* Guarantee consistency across our public and private GitHub resources.
* Leverage slideless deliveries and the reuse of existing public content. The content in our public GitHub repository should be:
    * Content that currently does not exist in the public documentation (and we should make sure we provide that feedback to the right product teams)
    * Custom content (e.g. specific walkthrought for the scenarios we support)
* Reach more customers with the content on the public GitHub repository
